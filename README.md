During pregnancy, women are usually treated by Obstetricians for pregnancy related problems but for other aliment they sometimes need to go to other specialists. These specialists donâ€™t prescribe for pregnant patient every now and then. So sometimes they need to double check the safety profile of a medication for the specific trimester of pregnancy before prescribing. This is very important because, some medication has harmful effect on fetus. Food and Administration has classified all the medication depending on their safety profile during pregnancy into Category A through D and X.
A = Controlled Studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester and the possibility of fetal harm appears remote
B = Animal studies show no risk, or if risk shown in animals, controlled trials in women showed no risk
C = Studies in animals with adverse effects and no human studies, OR no animal or human studies, but benefits of use may outweigh potential harms
D = There is evidence of human fetal risk, but benefits may outweigh risks
X = Contraindicated
